# Role-Based Redirection Test Guide

## âœ… Changes Made

I've successfully implemented role-based redirection for your disaster preparedness app. Here's what was updated:

### 1. **Updated Authentication Flow**
- **`src/pages/Auth.jsx`**: Removed role selection from login form and implemented proper role-based redirection
- **`src/pages/Login.jsx`**: Added role-based redirection after successful login
- **`src/services/AuthService.js`**: Cleaned up login function to get role from Firestore user profile

### 2. **How It Works Now**
- When a user logs in, the system fetches their role from Firestore
- Based on the role, users are automatically redirected to:
  - **Admin users** â†’ `/admin` (Admin Dashboard)
  - **Teacher users** â†’ `/teacher` (Teacher Dashboard)  
  - **Student users** â†’ `/` (Home/Student Dashboard)

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Create Test Users
1. Navigate to `/setup` in your app
2. Click "Create Predefined Users" button
3. Wait for the creation to complete

### Step 2: Test Role-Based Login
Use these predefined accounts to test:

#### Teacher Login Test:
- **Email**: `teacher1@d-prep.edu`
- **Password**: `teacher123`
- **Expected**: Should redirect to Teacher Dashboard (`/teacher`)

#### Admin Login Test:
- **Email**: `admin@d-prep.edu`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Expected**: Should redirect to Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

#### Student Login Test:
- **Email**: `student@example.com` (create a new account)
- **Password**: `your-password`
- **Expected**: Should redirect to Home page (`/`)

### Step 3: Verify Redirection
After logging in with each account type, verify that:
- âœ… Teachers see the Teacher Dashboard with class management tools
- âœ… Admins see the Admin Dashboard with analytics and compliance tracking
- âœ… Students see the Home page with learning modules

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Authentication Flow:
```javascript
// After successful login
const user = await login(email, password);
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  navigate('/admin', { replace: true });
} else if (user.role === 'teacher') {
  navigate('/teacher', { replace: true });
} else {
  navigate('/', { replace: true });
}
```

### Role Storage:
- User roles are stored in Firestore under the `users` collection
- Each user document contains: `{ role: 'admin' | 'teacher' | 'student' }`
- Role is fetched during login and used for redirection

## ðŸš€ Ready to Test!

Your role-based redirection is now fully implemented. Teachers and admins will automatically be directed to their respective dashboards upon login!

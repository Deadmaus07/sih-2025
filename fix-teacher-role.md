# 🔧 Fix Teacher Role Issue

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**
The debug panel shows that `teacher1@d-prep.edu` has **Role: student** instead of **Role: teacher**. This means the user's role in Firestore is incorrect.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

I've created a fix utility that will correct the user roles in Firestore. Here's how to fix it:

### **Step 1: Go to Setup Page**
1. Navigate to `/setup` in your browser
2. You'll see two buttons now:
   - **"Create Predefined Users"** (blue button)
   - **"Fix User Roles"** (yellow button) ← **Use this one!**

### **Step 2: Fix the Roles**
1. Click the **"Fix User Roles"** button
2. Wait for the success message: "✅ User roles fixed successfully!"
3. Refresh the page

### **Step 3: Test the Fix**
1. Go back to the login page
2. Login with `teacher1@d-prep.edu` / `teacher123`
3. Check the debug panel - it should now show **Role: teacher**
4. You should be redirected to the Teacher Dashboard

## 🔍 **What the Fix Does**

The fix utility:
- ✅ Updates the role in Firestore for all predefined users
- ✅ Ensures `teacher1@d-prep.edu` has `role: 'teacher'`
- ✅ Ensures `admin@d-prep.edu` has `role: 'admin'`
- ✅ Preserves all other user data

## 🎯 **Expected Result After Fix**

- **Debug Panel**: Should show `Role: teacher` instead of `Role: student`
- **Redirection**: Teacher should go to `/teacher` dashboard
- **Dashboard**: Should see teacher-specific interface with class management tools

## 🚀 **Quick Test**

After running the fix:
1. Login with `teacher1@d-prep.edu` / `teacher123`
2. You should see the Teacher Dashboard with:
   - Class management tools
   - Assignment creation
   - Drill scheduling
   - Analytics for classes

The role-based redirection should now work perfectly! 🎉

# 🔧 Debug Role-Based Redirection

## ✅ **Changes Made to Fix the Issue**

I've identified and fixed the main issue causing teachers to see the student dashboard. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

### **Problem Identified:**
1. **RoleGuard Timing Issue**: The `RoleGuard` component was checking user roles before the authentication state was fully loaded
2. **InferRoleFromEmail**: The function was always returning 'student' as default
3. **Async State Loading**: The role-based redirection was happening before the user profile was properly loaded

### **Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. **Updated `src/services/AuthService.js`**
- ✅ Improved `inferRoleFromEmail()` to detect teacher/admin emails
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging logs
- ✅ Better role detection from email patterns

#### 2. **Updated `src/components/RoleGuard.jsx`**
- ✅ Made RoleGuard wait for authentication state to load
- ✅ Added loading states to prevent premature redirects
- ✅ Fixed both `RoleGuard` and `AllowRoles` components

#### 3. **Updated `src/pages/Auth.jsx`**
- ✅ Added detailed debugging logs for login flow
- ✅ Better error handling and role detection

#### 4. **Added Debug Component**
- ✅ Created `DebugUser.jsx` to show current user info
- ✅ Added to Home page for testing

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Create Test Users**
1. Go to `/setup` in your browser
2. Click "Create Predefined Users" button
3. Wait for success message

### **Step 2: Test Teacher Login**
1. Go to `/login` or use the auth page
2. Login with: `teacher1@d-prep.edu` / `teacher123`
3. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to Teacher Dashboard (`/teacher`)
4. **Debug Info**: Check the debug panel on the home page to see user role

### **Step 3: Test Admin Login**
1. Login with: `admin@d-prep.edu` / `admin123`
2. **Expected Result**: Should redirect to Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

### **Step 4: Check Debug Information**
- The debug panel will show:
  - User name, email, role, UID, and institution
  - This helps verify the role is being set correctly

## 🔍 **Debugging Console Logs**

Open your browser's developer console (F12) and look for these logs:

```
Login - User data from Firestore: {role: "teacher", name: "Dr. Sarah Johnson", ...}
Login - Email: teacher1@d-prep.edu
Login - Final user profile: {role: "teacher", ...}
Auth.jsx - User after login: {role: "teacher", ...}
Auth.jsx - User role: teacher
Auth.jsx - Redirecting to teacher dashboard
```

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working**

If teachers are still seeing the student dashboard, check:

1. **Console Logs**: Look for any error messages in the browser console
2. **Firestore Data**: Verify the user document exists in Firestore with correct role
3. **Network Tab**: Check if Firestore requests are successful
4. **Debug Panel**: Check what role is shown in the debug panel

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix**

- ✅ **Teacher Login** → Teacher Dashboard with class management tools
- ✅ **Admin Login** → Admin Dashboard with analytics and compliance tracking  
- ✅ **Student Login** → Home page with learning modules
- ✅ **Debug Panel** → Shows correct role information

## 🧹 **Cleanup After Testing**

Once everything works, you can remove the debug component by:
1. Removing `import DebugUser from '../components/DebugUser';` from `src/pages/Home.jsx`
2. Removing `<DebugUser />` from the Home component
3. Deleting `src/components/DebugUser.jsx`

The role-based redirection should now work correctly! 🎉
